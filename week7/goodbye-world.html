    In 1957, Nelson co-wrote and co-produced what he describes as a pioneering rock musical entitled "Anything and Everything"; it was performed at Swarthmore College.Two years later, during his senior year at Swarthmore, Nelson made an experimental humorous student film, The Epiphany of Slocum Furlow, in which the titular hero discovers the meaning of life. Musician and composer Peter Schickele, also a student at Swarthmore College, scored the film.

    From the 1960s to the mid-2000s, Nelson built an extensive collection of direct advertising mail he received in his mailbox, mainly from companies selling products in IT, print/publishing, aerospace, and engineering. In 2017, the Internet Archive began to publish it online in scanned form, in a collection titled "Ted Nelson's Junk Mail Cartons".
